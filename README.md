# Description

This orbs is useful to merge a branch into another one push the result in a PR for approval. It can also notify on Slack if the merge is susccessful or not.

# Use case

It allows to pull up fixes done in one branch to another one, automatically, when there is no merge conflict. For example, it can pull up a fix merged in branch 1.0 in the branch 2.0.

Of course, if there is a unresolvable conflict, the merge would have to be done manually. In that case, the slack notification can help to do it as soon as possible.

# Deployment

It automatically increment the patch version and publish the orb when merging a PR in the `main` branch.For example, if there is an existing version `1.0.0` that exist, the next PR merged in `main` branch will create a new orb version `1.0.1`.

If there is a new feature that doesn't break anything for the users using this orb, please publish manually in your CLI a new minor version (such as 1.1.0).
